Binary Bomb
===========

IMPORTANT: This doesn't work yet!!! It has a lot of dependencies that currently
are just on my local machine. These include:
 - Buildroot and it's outputs (notably the linux VM)
 - The Qemu disk image generated from buildroot's rootfs output

Things todo before release:
 -== Repo ==-
 - Expand the build process so that it produces a distributable output that can
   given to the players.
 - Add a license file for the repo
 - Fix the README so that it's not just a to-do list and actually tells you 
   what the project is and how to use it.
 - Improve the run script so that it doesn't overwrite progress if the player
   has already started playing.
   - This will likely be fixed by having a run script that doesn't pull from
     the build output.

 -== Buildroot ==-

 -== Bomb ==-
 - Create detailed instructions/hints for each phase to guide the players.
   - For the initial release, there will probably just be a single unified
     guide that will be distributed with the bomb binary.
 - Scrap the secret phase for MVP

 -== Linux/Qemu ==-

Improvement Backlog
 -== Repo ==-
 - Create an init script that will start up everything easily.
   - Start up qemu with two serial ports (input/output and gdbserver)
   - This should include a tmux script that creates two panes for the two
     serial ports and enables mouse support for changing between the panes.
 - Create a dockerfile that manages the dependencies needed for the exercises.
   - qemu-system-arm
   - gdb-multiarch
   - gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf (or at least binutils)
   - tmux (optional for the custom UI)

 -== Buildroot ==-
 - We should create a bomb-defusal user that can read the guides but can't
   modify the bomb.
 - Figure out busybox logging since it's going to the console right now,
   which is annoying.
   - Something might be wrong with syslogd. There's an error about it during
     shutdown

 -== Bomb ==-
 - Create a randomizer script that can be run at init or on explosion.
   - It should add some randomness to the passwords of each phase so that
     everyone has to solve their own stuff.
   - If we do this, we'll have to find a way to solve the issue that the local
     copy of the binary won't be randomized, which will cause issues with
     debugging.
 - Create a bombd server that manages things like tracking the defusal status
   (phases completed, explosions, etc.)
   - This can help with the logistics of the secret phase, because the users
     can write code that sends a special key to the bomb-server.
   - This could help with the dynamic guide deployment since the server could
     provide new guides as each additional phase is unlocked.
   - There could also be a 'status' client for viewing the defusal stats.
 - Find a way to get the bomb to print the guide for each phase when it's
   diffused.
 - We should make sure there's a way to restart the bomb with a signal or
   something. We can have a custom gdb command for restarting it.
 - Create a tutorial (phase?) for basic gdb usage when the source is available.
 - Finish the secret phase on ACE or scrap it.
   - If we make the kernel module, we could have a secret code that gets sent
     to it to disable it.

 -== Linux/Qemu ==-
 - Should we have a serial port dedicated to the bomb and have a separate one
   for all of the users actual operations with the linux system.
 - Create a kernel module to represent the "bomb" (track lives and phases
   completed)
   - Note: This shouldn't be needed if we go with the bomb server idea.
