Binary Bomb
===========

IMPORTANT: This doesn't work yet!!! It has a lot of dependencies that currently
are just on my local machine. These include:
 - Buildroot and it's outputs (notably the linux VM)
 - The Qemu disk image generated from buildroot's rootfs output

Things todo:
 -== Repo ==-
 - Add all of the dependencies (i.e. buildroot) and scripts to build them
 - Expand the build process so that it produces a distributable output that can
   given to the players.

 -== Busybox ==-
 - Figure out busybox logging since it's going to the console right now,
   which is annoying.
 - Get auto-login working
 - Do some custom overlays to modify files that we want to be non-default.
   - /etc/inittab should automatically log in the user on the right serial port
   - the sysctl or whatever could disable ASLR instead of having an init script
 - Figure out how to get other files and configuration loaded into the rootfs
   output.
   - The bomb
   - Instructions
   - Init scripts for disabling ASLR

 -== Bomb ==-
 - Create detailed instructions/hints for each phase to guide the players.
 - Create a tutorial (phase?) for basic gdb usage when the source is available.
 - Finish the secret phase on RCE or scrap it.
   - If we make the kernel module, we could have a secret code that gets sent
     to it to disable it.
 - We should make sure there's a way to restart the bomb with a signal or
   something. We can have a custom gdb command for restarting it.

 -== Linux/Qemu ==-
 - We should make /etc/init.d scripts for disabling ASLR and starting the bomb
   and other stuff like that.

Looser ideas:
 -== Repo ==-
 - Create an init script that will start up everything easily.
   - Start up qemu with two serial ports (input/output and gdbserver)
   - This should include a tmux script that creates two panes for the two
     serial ports and enables mouse support for changing between the panes.
 - Create a dockerfile that manages the dependecies needed for the exercies.
   - qemu-system-arm
   - gdb-multiarch
   - gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf (or at least binutils)
   - tmux (optional for the init script)

 -== Busybox ==-
 - We should create a bomb-diffusal user that can read the guides but can't
   modify the bomb.

 -== Bomb ==-
 - Create a randomizer script that can be run at init or on explosion.
   - It should add some randomness to the passwords of each phase so that
     everyone has to solve their own stuff.

 -== Linux/Qemu ==-
 - Should we have a serial port dedicated to the bomb and have a separate one
   for all of the users actual operations with the linux system.
 - Create a kernel module to represent the "bomb" (track lives and phases
   completed)
