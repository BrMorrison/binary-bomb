Binary Bomb
===========

IMPORTANT: This doesn't work yet!!! It has a lot of dependencies that currently
are just on my local machine. These include:
 - Buildroot and it's outputs (notably the linux VM)
 - The Qemu disk image generated from buildroot's rootfs output

Things todo:
 - Add all of the dependencies and scripts to build them
 - Create an init script that will start up everything easily.
   - Start up qemu with two serial ports (input/output and gdbserver)
   - This should include a tmux script that creates two panes for the two
     serial ports and enables mouse support for changing between the panes.
 - Create detailed instructions/hints for each phase to guide the players.
 - Create a tutorial (phase?) for basic gdb usage when the source is available.
 - Create a dockerfile that manages the dependecies needed for the exercies.
   - qemu-system-arm
   - gdb-multiarch
   - gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf (or at least binutils)
   - tmux (optional for the init script)
