Improvement/Idea Backlog
 -== Repo ==-
 - Create a dockerfile that manages the dependencies needed for the exercises.
   - qemu-system-arm
   - gdb-multiarch
   - gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf (or at least binutils)

 -== Buildroot ==-
 - We should create a bomb-defusal user that can read the guides but can't
   modify the bomb.

 -== Bomb ==-
 - Create a randomizer script that can be run at init or on explosion.
   - It should add some randomness to the passwords of each phase so that
     everyone has to solve their own stuff.
   - If we do this, we'll have to find a way to solve the issue that the local
     copy of the binary won't be randomized, which will cause issues with
     debugging.
     - Ideally, the randomizer would run on the VM and copy the binary back to
       the host after updating it. That would prevent us from having libelf as
       a dependency or distributing x86 executables.
 - Create a bombd server that manages things like tracking the defusal status
   (phases completed, explosions, etc.)
   - This can help with the logistics of the secret phase, because the users
     can write code that sends a special key to the bomb-server.
   - This could help with the dynamic guide deployment since the server could
     provide new guides as each additional phase is unlocked.
   - There could also be a 'status' client for viewing the defusal stats.
 - Find a way to get the bomb to print the guide for each phase when it's
   defused.
 - Finish the secret phase on ACE or scrap it.
   - If we make the kernel module, we could have a secret code that gets sent
     to it to disable it.

 -== Linux/Qemu ==-
 - Should we have a serial port dedicated to the bomb and have a separate one
   for all of the users actual operations with the linux system.
 - Create a kernel module to represent the "bomb" (track lives and phases
   completed)
   - Note: This shouldn't be needed if we go with the bomb server idea.
