=== Bomb Phase 5 Guide

Solving phase 5 involves exploiting the fact that the return address is saved to the stack during a
function call. At the end of the function call, the return address is popped into the Program
Counter (PC) register and the continues executing code from there.
If this stored return address were to get overwritten, then it would change where the program
starts executing from after the function.

An important note for this phase is that ARM machines are little-endian, so the 4-byte word
0x0badcafe, would be stored in memory as 0xfe, 0xca, 0xad, 0x0b.
