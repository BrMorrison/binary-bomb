Endianness: Little
 - If you have a multi-byte number, like 0xdeadbeef, it will be stored in memory with the least significan byte first i.e. 0xefbeadde

Function calls and returns
 - A function call is normally done with the bl command, which jumps the PC to the specified command and saves the return address in the link register
   - Note, the link register is probably going to make the phases about overwritting the return address harder...
 - TOOD: Figure out what returns look like

Calling conventions
 - The first 4 registers (r0-r3) contain the first 4 parameters to a function (the rest are put on the stack)
   - The called function is free to modify these register values
   - r0 contains the return from the function after it completes execution.

Conditionals
 - Conditionals, like if-statements will usually be implemented with conditional branch instructions (bne, beq, ble, etc.)
 - These will usually come after a comparision instruction (tst) that sets the condition flags.

Loops
 - Loops are generally synthesized with a condition at the top of the loop and and unconditional jump at the bottom of the loop.
