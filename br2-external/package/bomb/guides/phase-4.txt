To solve phase 4, the player may need to use passwords that contain non-
printable bytes. The easiest way to achieve this is with a passwords file.
For example, the hex value 0xdeadbeef can be appended to a file called
`passwords.txt` with the following command.

`printf "\xde\xad\xbe\xef\x00" >> passwords.txt`

Note: When writing binary data to a text file like this, it is recommended that
you add a null terminator to the end with \x00 to assist with string
manipulations.
