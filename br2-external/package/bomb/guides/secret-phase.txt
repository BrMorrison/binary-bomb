- Bomb Secret Phase Guide -
---------------------------

With the control of the return address, the player can make the program execute
code from anywhere in memory... even memory on the stack...

To access this phase, you'll need to solve phase 5 with a specific password. To
solve this phase, you'll `phase_defused` a sixth time.

Here's a helpful bit of assembly code for this phase:

    movw    <ra>, <addr_low>
    movt    <ra>, <addr_high>
    mov     r0, <arg0>
    bx      <ra>

This loads an address into a register, `ra`, and then jumps to that address and
runs the code there with `arg0` as the first argument to the function.

Here's what that bit of code would look like assembled into machine code using
r5 as `ra`, 0x00010123 as the address, and 7 as the argument.

    0xe3005123
    0xe3405001
    0xe3a00007
    0xe12fff15

That should hopefully be helpful.
