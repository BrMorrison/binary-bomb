=== Phase 4

Phase 4 is where things get interesting. To solve this phase, you'll need to manipulate the stack
in a way that's more precisely than what was required for phase 3.
Specifically, you will need to enter a password that contains non-printable characters. The easiest
way to do this is with a passwords file and the `printf` command.
For example, to append the hex value 0xdeadbeef to the end of a file called `passwords.txt` you can
run

----
printf "\xde\xad\xbe\xef\x00" >> passwords.txt
----

Note: When writing binary data to a text file like this, I recommend that you add a null terminator
to the end of the line with \x00 to assist with string manipulations that the program might do.

To read files that contain binary data, you can use the `xxd` program to generate a hex dump.
